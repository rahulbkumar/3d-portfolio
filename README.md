# React + Vite

This is the code to my Personal Portfolio Website. It was made with Vite, React, Javacript, and ThreeJS. Originally inspired by Javascript Mastery's video.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
